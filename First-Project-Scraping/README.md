Short Description
  I am going to put a short description here. Things I need to address/want to address
  -What is X wing
  -What is the purpose of my CLI
  -What am I showing

  -Weekly top squads
    I want to be able to type in a date and see the first squad in each event in the past 7 days limited to 10 total. Each should be accessible to a second layer giving the list of ships and tournament data.
  -Percentage of the field playing the same ships
    need to iterate over the squad lists to see the number of ships that match self compared to number of ships total. I can do a simple counter that goes up each time the selected ship matches the total ships and then divide by the total to access the percentage.
